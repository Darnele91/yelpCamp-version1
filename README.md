Yelpcamp is a web app where you can go and rate your campground. You can add a new campground if it doesn't exist yet
and you can give your impression for other people to see. 
Version one is not fully functional yet.
Version one of yelpcamp does not have a database, we are using an array to show the campground.
One thing version two will address is adding a database(MongoDB) in a way that when you stop the server you can save the 
camground that you added.

It is really in an early stage. If you would like to add a new feature, please feel free. 
Stack: front-end: JavaScript, back-end: NodeJs and Express, Database: will be MongoDB
